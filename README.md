Ask the user for the name of an email file, e.g. mbox.txt.  Read the contents of the file and calculate how many emails are sent each day of the week, Sunday through Saturday.  The datetime module is one way to convert an arbitrary date to a day of the week but you may use any method you prefer.       Once you've collected the summary data, plot the data in a bar chart using any library you choose.   There's an overview of doing bar charts in MatPlotLib which is a very popular data visualization tool for Python and other languages.
